# Des-Moines-Bike-Sharing
## Overview:
- You'll use Pandas to convert the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype for this analysis. You'll next develop a set of visualizations utilizing the changed datatype to:
+ Show the amount of time that all riders and genders have their bikes checked out. For each hour of each day of the week, display the number of bike journeys for all riders and genders. For each day of the week, display the number of bike journeys for each kind of user and gender. Finally, for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors, you'll combine these new visuals with the two you developed earlier in this lesson.
## Results:
- Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
+ The data in the "tripduration" column is converted to a datetime datatype and has the correct time format.
